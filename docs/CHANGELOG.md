# Changelog - Pop-OS Optimizer

## üöÄ Version 2.0.0 - Refactored Development Edition

### ‚ú® New Features & Improvements
- **Full English Translation**: All scripts, documentation, and user-facing text have been translated from Italian to English.
- **Centralized Configuration (`config.sh`)**: Introduced a single `config.sh` file for all customizable settings, allowing users to easily tailor optimizations without modifying core scripts.
- **Modular Script Architecture**: Individual optimization tasks are now separated into dedicated, well-defined scripts (`optimize_cpu.sh`, `optimize_memory.sh`, etc.) for better maintainability and clarity.
- **Improved Main Script (`pop-os-optimizer.sh`)**: Consolidated functionality from `PopOsOptimizer.sh`, `master_dev_optimization.sh`, and `master_optimization.sh` into a single, robust, and user-friendly main script.
- **Enhanced Backup & Restore**: The backup system (`backup_safety.sh`) now creates more comprehensive backups and generates an interactive `restore.sh` script within each backup folder for selective rollback.
- **Safer GRUB Configuration**: GRUB modifications (`optimize_boot.sh`) now use `sed` for targeted changes, preserving existing settings and improving safety.
- **Generic System Information**: System statistics and tests are now more generic, reducing reliance on specific hardware models.
- **Improved Logging**: All scripts now use consistent logging functions for better traceability.
- **Updated Documentation**: `README.md` has been completely rewritten to reflect the new structure, usage, and customization options.
